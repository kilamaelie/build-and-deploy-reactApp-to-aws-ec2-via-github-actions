In today's digital landscape, it is of the utmost importance to create web applications that are not only feature-rich, but also secure.

Well, the end of this article, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to build and deploy a secure ReactJS application using Docker, NGINX, and automate the process with GitHub Actions to AWS EC2. With these powerful tools and best practices, you can confidently deploy your applications, knowing that they are both feature-rich and protected against potential security vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this project, which involves several technologies and concepts, you need a solid grounding in the following areas to ensure successful learning and implementation such as:

- **Basic Web development**: A good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is essential, as ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Git and version control**: A good knowledge of Git and version control concepts will help you manage your code base and collaborate effectively.
- **Docker**: Understanding containerization for docker is crucial to packaging your application and its dependencies in isolated containers.
- **NGINX**: A basic knowledge of NGINX as a web server and reverse proxy will be necessary to set up the server environment.

Remember, while these requirements are essentials, you donâ€™t need to be an expert in every area. You can learn and develop your expertise as you go along. Whatâ€™s more, official documentation, online tutorials and communities can provide invaluable support as you learn.

Let's get started on our journey.ðŸš€
